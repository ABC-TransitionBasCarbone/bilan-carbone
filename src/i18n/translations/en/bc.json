Of the 51 applications received for the first wave of 'Green Alternatives 2', 13 projects were selected, including the one led by CUT! The jury particularly praised the strong collective ambition serving the ecological transition of cinema and audiovisual, embracing the entire value chain of cinema, with the sponsorship of charismatic personalities from the industry.",

Consequently, the uncertainty about the length of the sum of the two strings will be less than the sum of the two uncertainties taken separately."
