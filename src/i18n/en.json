Of the 51 applications received for the first wave of 'Green Alternatives 2', 13 projects were selected, including the one led by CUT! The jury particularly praised the strong collective ambition serving the ecological transition of cinema and audiovisual, embracing the entire value chain of cinema, with the sponsorship of charismatic personalities from the industry.",

The following graphs also illustrate this effect.",

This is because two uncertainties cancel each other out, as it is generally uncertain whether the error will be made in the same direction. To give a concrete example, when measuring two strings, it is possible to overestimate the length of the first and underestimate the length of the second. Consequently, the uncertainty about the length of the sum of the two strings will be less than the sum of the two uncertainties taken separately."
